`iohandler_ctx`在主循环的顶端。

```c
static AioContext iohandler_ctx;
iohandler_ctx = aio_context_new(&error_abort);
```

`GSourceFuncs`结构体包含了一个函数表，由此来使用一种通用的方式处理事件源。

```c
static GSourceFuncs aio_source_funcs = {
    aio_ctx_prepare,
    aio_ctx_check,
    aio_ctx_dispatch,
    aio_ctx_finalize
};
```

`GSourceFuncs`包含了 4 个 function，原文解释如下：

```c
/**
 * GSourceFuncs:
 * @prepare: Called before all the file descriptors are polled. If the
 *     source can determine that it is ready here (without waiting for the
 *     results of the poll() call) it should return %TRUE. It can also return
 *     a @timeout_ value which should be the maximum timeout (in milliseconds)
 *     which should be passed to the poll() call. The actual timeout used will
 *     be -1 if all sources returned -1, or it will be the minimum of all
 *     the @timeout_ values returned which were >= 0.  Since 2.36 this may
 *     be %NULL, in which case the effect is as if the function always returns
 *     %FALSE with a timeout of -1.  If @prepare returns a
 *     timeout and the source also has a ready time set, then the
 *     lower of the two will be used.
 * @check: Called after all the file descriptors are polled. The source
 *     should return %TRUE if it is ready to be dispatched. Note that some
 *     time may have passed since the previous prepare function was called,
 *     so the source should be checked again here.  Since 2.36 this may
 *     be %NULL, in which case the effect is as if the function always returns
 *     %FALSE.
 * @dispatch: Called to dispatch the event source, after it has returned
 *     %TRUE in either its @prepare or its @check function, or if a ready time
 *     has been reached. The @dispatch function receives a callback function and
 *     user data. The callback function may be %NULL if the source was never
 *     connected to a callback using g_source_set_callback(). The @dispatch
 *     function should call the callback function with @user_data and whatever
 *     additional parameters are needed for this type of event source. The
 *     return value of the @dispatch function should be #G_SOURCE_REMOVE if the
 *     source should be removed or #G_SOURCE_CONTINUE to keep it.
 * @finalize: Called when the source is finalized. At this point, the source
 *     will have been destroyed, had its callback cleared, and have been removed
 *     from its #GMainContext, but it will still have its final reference count,
 *     so methods can be called on it from within this function.
 *
 * The `GSourceFuncs` struct contains a table of
 * functions used to handle event sources in a generic manner.
 *
 * For idle sources, the prepare and check functions always return %TRUE
 * to indicate that the source is always ready to be processed. The prepare
 * function also returns a timeout value of 0 to ensure that the poll() call
 * doesn't block (since that would be time wasted which could have been spent
 * running the idle function).
 *
 * For timeout sources, the prepare and check functions both return %TRUE
 * if the timeout interval has expired. The prepare function also returns
 * a timeout value to ensure that the poll() call doesn't block too long
 * and miss the next timeout.
 *
 * For file descriptor sources, the prepare function typically returns %FALSE,
 * since it must wait until poll() has been called before it knows whether
 * any events need to be processed. It sets the returned timeout to -1 to
 * indicate that it doesn't mind how long the poll() call blocks. In the
 * check function, it tests the results of the poll() call to see if the
 * required condition has been met, and returns %TRUE if so.
